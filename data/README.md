# Data

This folder is likely empty. There are two files that I work with. One is the dataset from GBIF, the other is the taxonomic classification from WFO.

The script can accept any data table from GBIF of any species, as long as the coordinates and dates are included in it. What remains static is the taxonomic classification which should not be substituted with any file except a backbone from ITIS.
